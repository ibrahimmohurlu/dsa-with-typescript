# Queue

Queue is a linear data structure orders elements in a line that we can insert (enqueue) elements at the end of the line and remove (dequeue) from the start. We can say that it is a special version of the linked list that has some constraints like enqueue at the end and dequeue from the start. Both enqueue and dequeue has the complexity of O(1).
