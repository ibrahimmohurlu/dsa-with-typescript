# Linked List

Linked list is a linear data structure. Instead of storing elements in a contiguous memory, linked list link elements (nodes) using pointers. Linked list has a head which is the start of the list. We can follow pointers to traverse the list. Insertion and deletions complexity is O(1) if we have the pointer to that node. If we don't have the pointer, first we need to traverse that node which is O(N). In this case complexity increases to O(N)+O(1) which is O(N).

Linked list has some various types;

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List
4. Circular Doubly Linked List
5. Header Linked List
