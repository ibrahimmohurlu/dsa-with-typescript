# Breadth First Search

Breadth First Search (on a tree) is a algorithm that searches tree by visiting nodes level by level (depth). Breadth first search works with Queue. We enqueue the current positions childs and traverse until Queue is empty. Breadth first search can also be used to traverse a tree.
