# dsa-with-typescript

This repository contains commonly used Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) implemented in TypeScript. Information in this repository might contain misunderstandings about DSA and errors. I consider this repository as a self notes on DSA to refer back later. Every data structure or algorithm has its own folder with <code>README.md</code> file.

[Bun](https://bun.sh) JavaScript runtime was used in this repository for a faster development environment. Bun can run <code>.ts</code> files without transforming TypeScript to JavaScript.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run tests:

```bash
bun test
```

To run specific test:

```bash
bun test linear-search
```

Runs <code>linear-search.test.ts</code>. To run other test files, use the name of the <code>\*.test.ts</code> file.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.22. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
